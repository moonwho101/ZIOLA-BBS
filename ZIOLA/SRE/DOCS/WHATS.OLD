This is the list of things that have changed in versions older than 0.990.

What's GONE in SRE 0.990
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  The Special Attacks option has been removed; it is always ON now.
2.  The Supply planets option has been removed; it is always ON.
3.  The lottery doesn't show up in the unregistered version so that
    you don't have money trapped in the bank.
4.  There is no "research menu" at the moment.  The research that is
    done is not under your control.
5.  Pirates no longer strike back the turn after a player attacks them;
    I am going to keep track of what the pirates think of each player,
    and they will attack players they don't like in a future version.
6.  I do not have SRE STATISTICS working yet.  It will be included
    in a future version.
7.  Most of the parameters have been removed and put into a sysop menu;
    to get to the sysop menu, run SRE SYSOP.
8.  All the support for an SRTERM program has been removed!!  It was
    making things very complicated and I was unable to do the configurable
    menus with that code in there.  (I never got around to writing
    SRTERM anyway, so it shouldn't matter much.)
9.  Several Resource options are gone, and can be set only at reset-time.
    Planets per turn and Sysop name are the only ones I can remember.
10. The INSTRUCTIONS and DISPLAY parameters have been removed.
    If someone wants them back, let me know so that I can put it on
    my list of things to do.  You can use the CREATEINSTRUCTIONS
    parameter to create ANSI and text instructions files for your
    users.
11. The "don't accept new players" date has not yet been implemented.

What's NEW in SRE 0.986g
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  The Special Attacks option has been moved into the Resource file,
    so if you had it enabled, please edit your resource file, and put
    "SpecialAttacks yes" in there.
2.  The Multitasker option in the Resource file now tells SRE to give
    up part of its time slice to Microsoft Windows or OS/2 when it
    is waiting for user input.  I have not tried this option with
    DESQview, but it may work in DV also.
3.  A bug that caused the system to beep at sysops who had the special
    attacks on in the unregistered version has been fixed.  I apologize
    for this!

What's NEW in SRE 0.986f/e
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  The players can now draft people into your military when defending
    against an attack; this is set in the same place the tax rate is set.
    See the online help (SRE HELP) for details on the drafting.
2.  A bug in 0.986e, where messages and chat mode wrapped incorrectly,
    was fixed.

What's NEW in SRE 0.986d
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  Some more bugs in the food market were fixed.
2.  A bug causing the News files to have extra carriage return (ASCII 13)
    characters in it was fixed.

What's NEW in SRE 0.986c
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  The bank investments have been fixed so that the interest rate is
    twice the rate for deposits.
2.  Setups now operate one-way only.  When a players sets up A and B,
    the result is that B thinks that A attacked him, but A does _not_
    think that B attacked him.  The results are in the news file also.
3.  Players can now send messages to themselves.  This may be useful
    when they want to remind themselves of something they have to do.
4.  Error/warning messages are displayed on the bottom of the screen
    when they occur.  They are also recorded in SYSOP.LOG.  These messages
    should probably be reported to The Solar Realm if they look serious.
5.  A couple of minor bugs in trading were fixed.
6.  The pirates have a limited idea of revenge, and they will occasionally
    strike back after a pirate raid.

What's NEW in SRE 0.986b
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  A bug with the input of numbers was fixed.
2.  A bug with entering negative numbers in the Resource file was fixed.

What's NEW in SRE 0.986
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  There is an ANSI news file (NEWS.ANS) as well as the text version
    (NEWS.TXT), and there is an Yesterday's News file in ANSI too.
2.  There is a new "attack" option, "Spy on Pirates".  It takes up your
    attack for that turn, but it displays spy info on each pirate team.
    (It's free, too!)
3.  A new resource option, DeleteDeadPlayers, can let you prevent dead
    players from starting over.
4.  A new resource option, InactiveTimeOut, lets you choose how long
    SRE waits before deleting an inactive player.  This used to be a RESET
    option; now it is in the resource file.
5.  There are new keys when doing numeric input:  'K' means 'thousand'
    and 'M' means million.  That way, you can enter "3M" to mean 3 million.
6.  There is a new System Menu option, V, which takes the player to
    the Advisors, who give some advice on the empire.
7.  The pirate teams will produce their own military/money/agents from
    the planets they have captured.  This will increase the rewards of
    defeating a pirate team.

What's NEW in SRE 0.985
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  The reports are rewritten!  You may notice that your REPORTS.SR file
    will be missing and it will replaced by RPT.SR, which is smaller.
2.  When you are asked whether you want to accept a treaty, you will be
    shown the empire's net worth, and if you have bribed a spy from their
    empire, you can spy on them too.  If you accept, you can send a message
    to your new ally.
3.  When you propose a treaty, you can send a message also.  In a future
    version, the message will appear with the treaty offer, like it should.
    However, until then, will appears with the other messages.
4.  The events are rewritten!  EVENT.SR replaces EVENTS.SR, and it should
    be much smaller!
5.  Covert op results, battle results, investment/miscellaneous results,
    and soon, treaty messages, will be displayed separately in their own
    colors.
6.  Events are processed each turn instead of each day.  This way, bank
    investments get back sooner.
7.  A bug in bank loans was fixed.
8.  The "bug" where users in protection can get attacked is "fixed".
9.  SRE ENEMY works in unregistered versions now.
10. Supply planets (including SRE SUPPLY) works in unregistered versions.

What's NEW in SRE 0.984
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  50 Generals can fit on one government planet instead of 40.
2.  Diplomacy option was added to the System Menu.
3.  Coverts or generals will kill each other if they don't have enough
    space on the government planets to survive.
4.  "Supply planets" are an option at reset-time; (used to be REGISTERED only)
    these planets supply all military units rather than only soldiers.  You can
    also toggle them with SRE SUPPLY.
5.  Fixed bug where the galactic coordinator gives too much money.
6.  Fixed bug that let users put spaces after the empire name.
7.  Installed new optimized ANSI routines.
8.  New message system, with longer word-wrapping messages.  One nice side
    effect is that even though the messages are longer, LESS space is taken
    up on disk!!!
9.  New message option:  SRE MESSAGE lets the sysop post a message
    (public or private) to the players
10. Problems with pirates having too much stuff when raided have been fixed.
11. Pirate teams will live past resets.  If you wish to delete the pirates,
    erase the file ENEMY.SR (at any time).
12. The amount the galactic coordinator gives to you depends on how nice
    you have been (with respect to chemical/nuclear attacks, galactic
    tax donations, and how many anti-pollution planets you have).
13. New option:  SRE SUPPLY  will let you select supply/soldier (REGISTERED)
14. New option:  SRE GAMESTATUS  will show you some information about the game.
15. New option:  SRE MSGREAD will let you read all the messages and
    see who they are from, even if the message was marked "anonymous" by
    the sender.
16. "Show Relations" on the diplomacy section will show the net worths of
    the other empires.
17. There are now TWO help files for SRE:  SREHELP.DAT is the standard one
    that comes with the game; HELP.DAT is one that you can create for your
    own customization.  See SREHELP.DAT for details on how to customize the
    help file.
18. Bug that caused lockups (actually a loop that took a minute to complete
    on a 16mhz system, but gave no indication that it was running) in
    trading was fixed.
19. Nuclear weapons are now 30,000,000 credits instead of 50,000,000.

What's NEW in SRE 0.983c
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  The bank investments are for a certain number of turns rather than a
    certain number of hours.  This is better when the number of turns each
    day is high, since you don't have to wait as long to get the investments
    back.
2.  Support added for an SRTERM that might be written in the future.
3.  Fixed bug with petroleum prices not being accurate if ^C was pressed
    during play.

What's NEW in SRE 0.983b
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1.  SRE MSGPACK will pack the messages.  Normally, this is done automatically
    each day, so you don't have to worry about it.
2.  New resource options Trading and Messages.  (explained in RESOURCE.HLP)
3.  Message bug with duplicating messages was fixed.

What's NEW in SRE 0.983
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Chat mode fixed up so that it'll work better with locked baud rates.
2.  SRE ENEMY allows you to edit the pirate names. (used to be REGISTERED only)
3.  Numeric input has been made better.
4.  F3 during chat turns the user's keyboard on and off.
5.  F1 during play displays a help window.
6.  F2 during play displays a status window to spy on your users.
7.  F7 and F8 decrease and increase user's time left, respectively.
8.  SRE.RC (Resource file from 0.982b) is OBSOLETE.  This means you have to
    redo all your changes.  (Sorry!)  The new resource file is RESOURCE.DAT.
    The format is different as well.  It's all explained in RESOURCE.HLP.
    The reason there's no RESOURCE.DAT included is so that when you upgrade,
    and unzip the new stuff into your directory, it won't delete the setup
    you have!
9.  A new option, SRE TURNS, allows you to change the number of turns granted
    per day.  (REGISTERED)
10. The INSTRUCTIONS, DISPLAY, and SCORES parameters work over the modem
    if you don't use the /LOCAL switch.  If you use /LOCAL, then it'll display
    to the screen instead of the modem.
11. ALT-J jumps (shells) to DOS if you have enough memory.  SRE doesn't
    swap to disk when shelling.  :(
12. GAMEFULL.ANS or GAMEFULL.TXT is displayed when the game is full and
    a user tries to start a new empire.  (If the .ANS file exists AND the
    user has ANSI, it is displayed; otherwise it displays the .TXT file.)
    That way, if you have two or three games running, you can tell the user
    to try another game.
13. Pirate Raids let you know what you've lost fighting the pirates.
14. Treaties can be individually enabled/disabled from RESOURCE.DAT.
15. SRE STATISTICS displays statistics about your game.
16. The LOCKOUT.USR file can have names of users that you want to lock out
    of a game.  Just create the file and list the users, one on each line,
    that should not be allowed to play.  (The user name should be listed
    the same way that it would appear on the status bar when that user
    plays.)  Also, the LOCKOUT.ANS or LOCKOUT.TXT files are displayed when
    that user attempts to play.
17. The help system is even easier to use, and there are options in the
    resource file to select which type of help input you'd like.
18. There are resource options to selectively turn off nuclear and/or
    chemical attacks.  (REGISTERED)
19. You (the sysop) can add your own ANSI screens to SRE.  See SRE.DOC
    for info on where these ANSI screens are displayed.
20. You can specify a date to stop accepting new players into a game,
    and when a user tries to play after that, SRE will display NOMORE.TXT
    (or NOMORE.ANS if it exists).  (REGISTERED)

What's NEW in SRE 0.982
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Two status bars.  (Wow.)
2.  A resource file - SRE.RC - that lets you change the COM port parameters
    and the length of timeout before the keyboard times out.  (And others)
3.  Bug with short prompts and petroleum planets not giving money has been
    fixed.
4.  Number of turns of protection bug has been fixed; previously, it gave
    one extra turn of protection.
5.  Parameters such as /ANSI=0 didn't work with the DISPLAY or INSTRUCTIONS
    parameters; now they do.
6.  FINALLY!  SRE Checks time left on the board.  On some door types, I was
    not able to figure out how much time was left, so SRE lets you play for
    an unlimited amount of time.  Also, if the time left doesn't work for you
    (SRE expects minutes and your door type gives seconds or hours), you
    can disable the time-limit feature by using the command line option
    /NOTIMELIMIT.  You can also edit SRE.RC to add the "No Time Limit"
    option.  If you do want the time limit, use /TIMELIMIT [the resource
    file option is "Time Limit"].  The default is unspecified, and may
    change in future versions, so I strongly advise you edit SRE.RC and
    set your preference.
7.  Bug with reports (bank investments and covert operation results) not
    showing up has been corrected.
8.  Bug that made results of battles with over 3000 soldiers/fighters/
    cruisers has been fixed.  Battle formulas are all-new (maybe not
    better).
9.  Help is now context-sensitive.  You can type "just enough" for SRE to
    fill in the rest, and press TAB to complete the word or just press
    RETURN if it's finished.  (This also applies to bulletins.)
10. Running "SRE /?" will list all the parameters & switches.
11. Pressing ">" on a prompt will fill in the "max" value.  This is very
    useful in the bank, to Withdraw All or Deposit All.
12. Bug with entering long registration codes has been fixed.  (It said
    "Thanks for registering" after you type in the numbers, but it didn't
    actually register the game.)
13. Some support (?) for COM3-8.  You can edit [RESOURCE.DAT] to define your
    COM ports.  (Untested)  This -should- work for IRQ levels 3 and 4.

What's NEW in SRE 0.981
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Problem with attacking is fixed.  In 0.980, attacking did too much damage.
2.  Problem that caused enemy players not to appear has been fixed.
3.  Problem that prevented a player from *completely* destroying another with
    conventional attacks has been corrected.
4.  F5 key returns the user to the BBS.
5.  Scores won't show up locally when writing to SRESCORES.TXT/SRESCORES.ANS.

What's NEW in SRE 0.980
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Both Short and Long instruction files.  This is to encourage users to
    read the short one if they're intimidated by the long one.
2.  A new user message in NEWUSER.ANS/NEWUSER.TXT that is          (REGISTERED)
    displayed when a new player joins the game.
3.  Reset in the unregistered version gives more options (Pirate Raid)

What's NEW in SRE 0.979
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
0.  Since there never was a 0.979, there isn't anything new here.

What's NEW in SRE 0.977
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  IMPORTANT!!  Use the NEW "RESEARCH.DAT" file from the ARJ/ZIP
2.  Major bug in Pirate Raids fixed.                               (REGISTERED)
3.  Many options in RESET:  date to start game, number of days before
    maintenance is run, whether the name of a defender in an attack is shown
    in the news file, whether failed covert ops are shown in the news file,
    and whether special attacks are allows.                        (REGISTERED)
4.  The /BIOS switch is temporarily set to be default.  /FASTWRITE forces the
    direct screen writes.
5.  Much internal `cleaning up'.  The code size decreased by about 15k.

What's NEW in SRE 0.976
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Bug involving too high Galactic Coordinator taxes is fixed.  If you had
    urban planets, the GC would charge you too much, usually more than you
    have.
2.  Nuclear bombs have a maximum planet capacity of 300.  This varies during
    play.  This also overrides "What's NEW in SRE 0.974", #3.
3.  Having government planets now reduces the severity of a civil war caused
    by not paying the planets.  The civil war caused by not feeding the
    people is not affected.
4.  IMPORTANT!!!  Delete REPORT.SR

What's NEW in SRE 0.975
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Bulletins available at the main menu.  Edit SREHELP.DAT and add bulletins
    in the form:
       #key bulletin-®name¯
       ®text¯
       #end
    The text is word wrapped unless there is a \n in the file; the "\n" forces
    movement to the next line.  The '\' character at the end of a line is a
    place keeper.  Some editors erase spaces at the end of a line.  The \ is
    ignored by SRE, but allows you to have a space at the end of a line.
2.  Customizable help topics.  Help topics are available from the system menu.
    They are in the form #key help-®name¯.  See #1 for more details.
3.  Editable hints.  These are also in SREHELP.DAT, with the same format as
    #1 and #2 above.
4.  User Preferences menu.  If users are pressed for time, they can turn off
    some of the verboseness of SRE, at the expense of making the game look
    ugly.
5.  Fast files.  The files are MUCH faster than those of 0.970.  However, on
    some computers (386/33), you may not notice.
6.  Main Menu now contains 9 options instead of 6.  The new ones:  Status,
    See Bulletins, and Diplomacy.

What's NEW in SRE 0.974
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Computer-controlled enemies can be attacked with Pirate Raid.  There
    are 9 computer enemies that steal things from players.  The players can
    attack back and take back their items.                         (REGISTERED)
2.  Guerilla attacks work now!                                     (REGISTERED}
3.  Nuclear attacks kill 25% of the opponent's planets.            (REGISTERED)
4.  Chemical attacks kill 50% of the opponent's population.        (REGISTERED)
5.  Saves in a turn.  If the user hangs up during play, it saves the place
    and starts there again next time.
6.  New covert op:  Treaty Spy, #7.
7.  Investments.  At the bank, you may invest money and it will return
    in 36 real hours.

What's NEW in SRE 0.973
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Planet prices in protection are much lower than they used to be.  This
    will allow the empires to grow much faster.
2.  Main Menu available by editing the batch file.  Change
       SRE
    to
       SRE /MENU
3.  News files NEWS.TXT and YESTNEWS.TXT list major events of the day.

What's NEW in SRE 0.972
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Some covert operations now include a risk factor displayed before
    the player is certain that he/she/it wants to perform the covert op.
2.  New covert operation:  Bombing, #6
3.  F10 = chat.  Chat finally works acceptably.  Control-R + a number
    changes colors.

What's NEW in SRE 0.971
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1.  Bug fix:  the Abdicate option didn't work.  It caused a "divide error"
    and sometimes locked up the system.

2.  Scores files generated automatically --- SRE produces SRESCORES.ANS and
    SRESCORES.TXT every time its run instead of the batch file running
    SRE SCORES.

3.  The batch file needs to be created again.  Re-Run SRINSTAL's Batch File
    Setup option.

4.  The instruction file can be sent to a file with
    SRE INSTRUCTIONS /LOG /ANSI=1
    to produce an ANSI instruction file (SRE.LOG), or
    SRE INSTRUCTIONS /LOG /ANSI=0
    to produce a non-ANSI instruction file (also in SRE.LOG).  You can
    then copy SRE.LOG to another file.  This need only be done once.

What's NEW in SRE 0.970
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

1.  Instantaneous petroleum price fluctuations.  This prevents one user from
    taking advantage of extremely high petroleum prices.  It is also more
    realistic for the game.
2.  Guerilla Warfare
    Explained in the instructions to the game.
3.  Several command-line options:
    A.  /ANSI=0
        Forces ANSI off.  Can be used with /LOG and SCORES to produce
        a non-ANSI score file.
    B.  /ANSI=1
        Forces ANSI on.  Can be used with /LOG and SCORES to produce
        an ANSI score file.
    C.  /LOG
        Writes all output to a log file, SRE.LOG.  (In ANSI if ANSI is on).
        You can also use this option to extract the instructions to a file
        with "SRE /LOG": play the game, and view the instructions.  Then
        and edit the SRE.LOG file and copy the instruction part to a
        separate file.
    D.  /BIOS
        Uses the BIOS for output instead of direct-screen writes.  Use
        this for non-compatible computers or multi-tasking systems.
        You can also use this to get rid of snow on CGA systems.
    E.  /NOSPECIALEFFECTS
        Turns off the special effect cursors at Yes/No prompts and at
        pauses.  This greatly reduces the size of the LOG file.  Also,
        some modems have bufferring that continues output even after
        the user has pressed a key.  If so, this option will speed up
        remote game operation.  (Ask users if PAUSE immediately goes
        away when they press a key or if there's a delay; if there is
        a delay, use this option.)
    F.  /LOCAL
        For BBS door files that don't send the right message to SRDOOR
        that the user is local, this option forces LOCAL play.
4.  Batch file setup inside of SRINSTAL.  You don't have to run two programs
    (SRINSTAL, SETUPBAT) to install SRE --- just one.

What's NEW in SRE 0.965
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

1.  New planet types (Anti-Pollution, Petroleum)
2.  System Menu (in the Government Spending Menu)
    A.  Super Lottery - Buy tickets and the game picks a winner daily
    B.  Scores
    C.  Check trade deals that had to be rejected because player couldn't
        meet the demands
    D.  Covert Operations
    E.  Bank
    F.  Show Status
    G.  Set Tax Rate
    H.  Toggle Expert Mode
    I.  Abdicate
    J.  Change Colors
3.  Bank available before paying planets
4.  All-new improved SETUPBAT program, that allows:
    A.  Outputting the scores to a separate ANSI/text file
    B.  Recording all actions of all players in a trap file
5.  A nicer-looking status bar
6.  Command line parameters:
    REGISTER
    Registration of the game.  If you send the registration form in,
    we will send you three code numbers to you that you type in with
    this option.
    REREGISTER
    Registration of the game if it is already registered to someone else.
    BANK
    Setup of the bank:  creates the bank and sets an interest rate.  This is
    available in the registered version only.
    RESET
    Erase all players, and set options.  Options are only available in the
    registered version.
    SCORES
    Displays only the scores.  Either run "SRE SCORES" as a door program
    to allow the scores to be sent to the user directly or create a score
    file with "SRE SCORES /LOG /ANSI=1 /LOCAL" and copy SRE.LOG to another
    file.  ("SRE SCORES /LOG /ANSI=0 /LOCAL" for a non-ANSI score file)

(See the new instruction file for details)
